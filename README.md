About the Author 


George H. Malouf is a writer whose life and work form a rich tapestry, woven from threads of deep heritage, entrepreneurial spirit, and a profound dedication to the literary arts. Born in Jerusalem in 1946 to Lebanese-Palestinian parents, his early years were marked by the transience that reshaped the post-war Middle East. In 1948, his family found refuge in his father's ancestral homeland, Lebanon, settling in the ancient port city of Tyre. It was there, amidst Phoenician ruins and the Mediterranean Sea, that his foundational years were steeped in layers of history, attending the city's Greek and Latin Catholic schools and absorbing the dual traditions of Eastern Christianity and Western humanism.

At the age of twelve, his family sought new horizons, immigrating to the United States and settling in the Texas Panhandle. This stark new landscape was a world away from the Levant, yet George carried the cadences of his multilingual childhood within him. He pursued his education at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, where a pivotal encounter with Yiota, a woman of Greek descent, would beautifully align with his own destiny. Their courtship blossomed into a marriage celebrated in her ancestral village of Klitoria, Greece—a vibrant fusion of Levantine and Hellenic culture that would become a central theme in his life and writing.

Together, George and Yiota built a life that masterfully balanced commerce and creativity. As entrepreneurs, they successfully launched a series of ventures, from department stores to western wear and ladies’ boutiques, embedding themselves in the Texan commercial landscape. Yet, throughout this journey, George’s true vocation persisted. His first collection of poetry, The Lovely Blue & Sad Moments (1982), was a tender ode to his wife and an exploration of love’s enduring, delicate nature. This debut heralded a prolific literary career that would continually draw upon his Lebanese roots, his Greek familial ties, and his Texan surroundings.

His subsequent works reveal a scholar’s mind and a poet’s soul. The genealogical masterpiece Maloof—The Ghassani Legacy (1992) traces his family's lineage to the pre-Islamic Ghassanid kingdom, a monumental work of translation and archival research that bridges ancient Arab history with modern diaspora narratives. In Papou’s Proverbs—1001 Grecian Words of Wisdom (2012), he pays homage to Yiota’s heritage, presenting bilingual aphorisms that blend rustic Greek wisdom with his own lyrical flair. His recently published works, Echoes Across the Seas, My Father’s Odyssey (2025), chronicles the family's exodus from regional turmoil to the peaceful achievement of the American Dream on the South Plains of Texas, and Fissure, A Rift in the Void (2025), a Science Fiction novel about an Archaeologist, who is driven to the brink by the dangerous knowledge gained from an alien device and must race to conceal his accidental unleashing of a terrifying void entity before the compromised seal fails and triggers a cosmic catastrophe.


Malouf’s poetry collections—including Ethereal Moment of Truth (1984), Ripples in Time (2012), and Whispers Beneath the Vine (2018)—have garnered critical acclaim for their lyrical precision and emotional depth. As reviewer Annie Polston of Indiana’s “Elkhart Truth” noted, “Malouf’s poetry soothes the heart—a trip through the very soul of man.” His work has been featured in numerous anthologies, from The American Poetry Anthology to The World Treasury of Great Poems, and has earned him accolades such as the Golden Poetry Awards and the National Library of Poetry’s Awards of Merit.

A polyglot fluent in six languages, Malouf has also undertaken significant translation projects, bringing Renaissance poetic forms to English-speaking audiences. Now in his seventh decade, he resides in Lubbock with Yiota. Their home is a vibrant center of family life, shared with their three children and seven grandchildren, who are the inheritors of a legacy that mingles Texan fortitude with Mediterranean storytelling.

In recognition of his contributions to cross-cultural dialogue through literature, he was awarded the “Key to the City” of Birmingham, Alabama, in 1999. Today, George H. Malouf continues to write, his study a testament to an insatiable curiosity. Current projects include new volumes of poetry and a memoir that interweaves the narrative of his life—from his birth in Jerusalem and boyhood in Tyre to his fulfilling years in Texas. In him, one finds a rare synthesis: the merchant and the mystic, the immigrant and the poet, a man whose story is a living bridge between epochs and continents.
